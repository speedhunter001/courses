range() is a generator

def myrange(n)
	x = 0
	while x < n:
		yield x
		x = x + 1

(What yield do is that it returns the number and maintains the function state so next time myrange is called it will run line x = x + 1 and so on,now this function is a generator because it has yield keyword in it)

for i in myrange(5):
	print(i)

r = myrange(5)
next(r)						(it is the same as iteration)
							
%time g = ( i**2 for i in range(100000) )
							( parenthesis at the start and the end are for generator syntax )
