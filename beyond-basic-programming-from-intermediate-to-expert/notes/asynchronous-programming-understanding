Asynchronous understaning:

1.An event loop manages and distributes the execution of different tasks. It registers them and handles distributing the flow of control between them.

2.Courotines are special functions that work similarly to Python generators, on await they release the flow of control back to the event loop. A coroutine needs to be scheduled to run on the event loop, once scheduled coroutines are wrapped in Tasks which is a type of Future.

3.Futures represent the result of a task that may or may not have been executed. This result may be an exception.
