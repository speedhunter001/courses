NUMPY:

Numeric python

Used for converting lists into arrays so now we can do attition etc on our lists

Great for vector arithmetic

We can also use boolean operations 

light = np.array(bmi<21)  (creates a boolean array for elements less than 21)

print(bmi[light])  (If we do print light then the boolean array is given so we give it as index)

mean,median,standard deviation etc and correlation are many methods of numpy

corr = np.corrcoef(np_baseball[:,0], np_baseball[:,1])  (The correlation between first and second column)
