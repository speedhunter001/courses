import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(x_list, y_list)

plt.hist(x_list, number_of_bins/khaane)

plt.scatter(x_list, y_lsit, s = size_of_each_dot_list, c = colour_list, alpha = opacity) 
						(opacity should be from 0 to 1,0 means completely transparent,1 is not transparent at all)

plt.xscale('log')        (sets the x scale as logarithmic scale)

plt.xlabel("x label")
plt.ylabel("y label")
plt.title("title")

plt.text(x, y, "Blahbalh")

plt.grid(True) 			(Draw grid lines on the graph)

plt.show()       		(This should be done after doing all the three customizations whether in line graph,scatter or histogtram)
