TRAVERSING THE DOM:

let variable = document.querySelector(#items);   (It can be class or an id etc)

variable.parentNode;   (Like there is something inside div tag then div is parent and inside it the tags are its child and they are siblings to each other)

variable.parentElement	(.parentNode and ParentElement for the most part can be interchangeable)

variable.childNodes;	(It gives a Nodelist,It can even catch linebreaks which i.e actual space between lines not the tag and it will call it text so better not use this)

variable.children;		(It gives an htmlCollection,it does not catch the actual linebreaks)

variable.firstChild;	(It also catches the linebreaks i.e called text)

variable.firstElementChild		(It works fine and it does not catches the linebreaks)

variable.lastChild;	(It also catches the linebreaks i.e called text)

variable.lastElementChild		(It works fine and it does not catches the linebreaks)

variable.nextSibling;	(It also catches the linebreaks i.e called text)

variable.nextElementSibling		(It works fine and it does not catches the linebreaks,it will also give us null if there is no sibling)

variable.previousSibling;	(It also catches the linebreaks i.e called text)

variable.previousElementSibling		(It works fine and it does not catches the linebreaks)



let newDiv = document.createElement('div');		(It creates a new Element)

newDiv.className = 'hh';   (This is used for adding class to the tag)

newDiv.id = 'jjj'; 		(This is used for adding id to the tag)

newDiv.setAttribute('title', 'Hello dd')	(This method requires two parameters,this will create an attribute inside div tag title='hellodd')

let newdivtext = document.createTextNode('Hello world');		(This creates the text node but we actuall need to insert it inside div tag)

newDiv.appendChild(newDivText);		(This inserts the text now in div tag)

let container = documetn.querySelector('header .container');		(Inside header tag the container class,Now we need to insert the div tag inside the HTML collection that is in DOM)

let h1 = document.querySelector('header h1');		(Inside header tag h1)

container.insertBefore(newDiv, h1);		(This takes two parameters,the tag you want to insert and the second whose before you want to insert the tag)
