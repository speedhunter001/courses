BOOTSTRAP:
Bootstrap is front-end framework meaning its used on the client not on the server.
Specifically used for user interfaces and themes.
It includes bits of HTML/CSS/Javascript.
Used for building responsive,mobile first(designing for small screens first and then working up to the larger screens,so great for mobile apps and and mobile websites) wer applications and websites.
Most popular framework by far.
Increases development speed:   All helper classes for alignment and style and positioning they are all done,All you need to worry about is adding those classes to you HTML
Responsiveness:    Instead of using custom media queries and creating a responsive site frim scratch you can simply use the grid system and you will have a mobile friendly website
Consistency:  With class names,style markup keeps your website and your theme very consistent
Customizable:    You can add you own classes and your own design to any bootstrap theme
Support:    Has a huge community
We also have many javascript widgets and helpers like Transitions,Modals,Dropdowns,Tabs etc.

INSTALL METHODS:
1.Download the files including sass and less but we will take the distributed code of html and javascript and include it in our template	
2.You can use CDN(Content Delivery Network)by a script tag or link in CSS but its hosted somewhere else so you can't do it offline,you need internet
3.You can also us Bower,its a client side package manager
4.NPM is also a package manager on the back end side that has to do with nodejs using javascript and server
Other ways too
You also need to include Jquery,it uses jquery for all javascript widgets

You can see tutorials or documentation and downloads in getbootsrtap.com

<link href="css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">  (For now only this file)

<div class="container">
	<h1>hello lolo</h1>
</div>    (container is very importan class it does some stuff for us)

for heading there is a class called page-header

If you want a paragraph that kinds of sticks our you will need lead class

<mark>Hooo</mark>    (This higlights)

<del>ooo</del>       (this text is now crossed out i.e a line over the text)

ALIGNMENT AND TRANSFORMATION:
text-left
text-center
text-right
text-justify
text-nowrap
These are all the classes

text-lowercase
text-uppercase
text-capitalize   (This capitalizes the first letter of each word)

QUICK FLOATS:
pull-right
pull-left

These are also classes
but after we float something we use clear so class for that is clear-fix

BLOCKQUOTE
<bockquote classe="blockquote">
	....
	<footer>quote by<cite title="john">john</john>
</blockquote>
(this method is for blockquotes but if we want the name of footer to appear on right so we use classe blockquote-reverse)

LIST
<ul class="list-unstyled">
	<li>one</li>
	<li>two</li>
</ul>    (This gives the list without the black dots)

<ul class="list-inline">
	<li>one</li>
	<li>two</li>
</ul>     (the list items appear on one line without black dots)

CODE:
<code>&lt;h1&gt;Heading text&lt;/h1&gt;</code>
(In this way Headig text will appear with h1 tags)

Change directory with<kbd>cd</kbd>    (kbd stands for keyboard tag,it highlights the cd in a particular way)

to edit press <kbd><kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd></kbd>

CONTEXTUAL COLORS:
text-primary    (blue)
text-success    (faintly green)
text-info       (light blue)
text-warning    (yellow)
text-danger     (red)
text-muted      (light grey)

bg-primary   
bg-success    
bg-info       
bg-warning    
bg-danger     
bg-muted      

CONTEXTUAL BUTTONS:
For buttons,link(a tag),input we can use class btn-default

btn-default
btn-primary		(blue)
btn-success		(green)
btn-info		(light blue)

btn-danger		(red)
btn-link        (now its a link with no border)

We can also have help-block class 

By using type="file" in an input tag it allows us to select a file

There is also a class for checkbox named checkbox

form-inline class can be used if we want all the fields to be on one line,but it works upto a certain size of browser

TABLE:
table  (this class makes the class look nice and clean)
table-striped  (gives a good effect)
table-hover    (it changes when you hover it)
table-bordered  (applies changes to borders)
table-condensed  (makes the table a bit smaller)

succes   (makes the thing green)
other colours lke before

All of these are classes



If we add list-group class to ul tag then it doesn't shows any effectt so we also need to add a list-group-item to each li tag it gives a good effect

class="active"  (makes it active)

list-group-item-success   (makes it green)

PANELS:
A panel in bootstrap is a bordered box with some padding around its content.

The <span> tag is used to group inline-elements in a document.

The <span> tag provides no visual change by itself.

The <span> tag provides a way to add a hook to a part of a text or a part of a document.

If you define a label inside h1 etc its size will be bigger

		heelll
	</div>
</div>


col-md-8    (It means 8 columns of medium size and similarly others)

If you change the browser size and you don't want the text to change their columns then you can write col-sm-n col-xs-n , n is the number of columns in the same tag
